        This is the JTux Workstation Programming Reference. This document describes the 
        Java API for Tuxedo/WS provided by JTux Workstation.
    </p>
    <h3>The JTux Workstation API</h3>
    <p>
        The JTux Workstation API is a direct mapping of the Tuxedo's native C API to 
        Java. The methods of the <a href="jtux.atmi.ATMI_method_tables.html">jtux.atmi.ATMI</a>
        class, for example, are the Java versions of Tuxedo's native ATMI functions. 
        Similary, the methods of the <a href="jtux.fml32.FML32_method_tables.html">jtux.fml32.FML32</a>
        class are the Java versions of Tuxedo's native FML32 functions. The different 
        Tuxedo data structures are also mapped to Java in a straightforward manner, as 
        shown by, for example, the <a href="jtux.atmi.TPINIT_field_tables.html">jtux.atmi.TPINIT</a>
        and <a href="jtux.atmi.TPQCTL_field_tables.html">jtux.atmi.TPQCTL</a> class 
        definitions.
    </p>
    <h3>Differences with Tuxedo's Native C API</h3>
    <p>
        Although the JTux Workstation API is mostly similar to Tuxedo's native C API, 
        there are also some differences. In particular, the following topics deserve 
        special attention.
        <dl>
            <dt><b>Error and event reporting</b></dt>
            <dd>
                The JTux Workstation API reports errors and events by throwing exceptions. The 
                methods of the jtux.atmi.ATMI class, for example, throw exceptions of type 
                {@link jtux.atmi.TPException} and the methods of the jtux.fml32.FML32 class 
                throw exceptions of type {@link jtux.fml32.FException} to signal the occurrence 
                of errors and events.
            </dd>
            <dt><b>Typed buffer handling</b></dt>
            <dd>
                The JTux Workstation API uses instances of the java.nio.ByteBuffer class to 
                represent Tuxedo typed buffers. Special care should be taken that these buffers 
                are properly cleaned up as they are <em>not</em> managed by the Java garbage 
                collector.
            </dd>
            <dt><b>Passing parameters by reference</b></dt>
            <dd>
                The JTux Workstation API uses holder classes to allow method parameters to be 
                passed by reference. These holder classes are defined in the {@link 
                jtux.holders} package.
            </dd>
        </dl>
    </p>
    <h3>Sample Applications</h3>
    <p>
        The following sample applications are available to get you started developing 
        your own Tuxedo/WS clients in Java. For instructions on how to compile and run 
        these samples see the <a href="../JTuxWS_jar.html">JTuxWS.jar</a> manual page.
